		question: "How often should I exercise?",
		answer:
		    "As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. If you want to lose weight, keep off lost weight or meet specific fitness goals, you may need to exercise more. Cutting down on  junk foods and sitting time is important, too.",
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
		answer :
			"Research on exercise timing and performance is mixed. However, ongoing studies suggest that afternoon or evening exercise may improve athletic performance. One study examined how time of day affects high-intensity exercise performance. The results indicate that performance peaks between 4PM and 8PM."
    },
	{
		id: 3,
		question: "How long should my workouts be?",
		answer:
	     "If you're doing just two strength training workouts per week, they should last between 45 and 90 minutes. The exact duration depends on individual factors, like experience, fitness, and goals. For more frequent sessions, four to six per week, each workout can be much shorter, even just 30 minutes."
	},
	{
		id: 4,
		question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
		answer:
		  "A warm up is the very first thing you should do when you begin a workout session. If you don't warm up, even your initial stretching exercises can cause injury. Indeed, forms of exercise such as Pilates are heavily focused on stretching and balance, but you should still spend time warming up before you commence."
},
	{
		id: 5,
		question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
		answer:
		  "If your main goal is weight loss, you want to burn calories and build muscle mass. So, for optimal benefits, you should incorporate both cardio and strength training into your exercise routine."
		},
	{
		id: 6,
		question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
		answer:
		  "Weight training is an excellent way to build muscle mass and make your muscles stronger. It can also keep your metabolism chugging, strengthen your bones and joints, improve your muscle tone, help you burn more calories, and keep you healthier as you age."
